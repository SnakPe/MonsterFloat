### A small library for arbitrary-length rational numbers

*monsterflat* is a small library for arbitrary-length and -precision math. Numbers are represented as fractions, with two `bigint`'s as arguments. 
Alternatively, using the `from` method allows creation of monsterfloats using `bigint`, `number` and `string`.
